 //Creating Object

const student = {
  name:  "Oyelowo Oyedayo",
  introduce: function() {
    return "My name is " + this.name;
  },
  
  campus: {
    street: "Kumpula",
    city: "Helsinki",
    Country: "Finland"
  }
};


console.log(student.introduce());
console.log(student.name + " studies at " + student.campus.street);

//Adding objects
student.campus.building = "Physicum"
console.log(student.name + "'s main building is " + student.campus.building);

#CREATING MULTIPLE OBJECTS USING A CONSTRUCTOR
it is a good common practise to start constructor name with an uppercase.
